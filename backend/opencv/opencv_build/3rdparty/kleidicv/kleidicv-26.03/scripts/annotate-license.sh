# This is a helper script for developers to check and automate inclusion of
# correct license headers in their commits. It relies on `reuse` tool available
# at https://reuse.software
#
# The script is meant to be run before committing changes (after `git add`,
# before `git commit`) and can be turned into a pre-commit hook . It would check
# staging files for correct Arm copyright and amend copyright if needed. In case
# of outdated copyright year - extends the copyright.
# For non-recognisable file formats, such as .patch it would enforce c-style
# comment - it is recommended to check amended file to make sure this style is
# compatible with the file type.
# If any changes has been made as a result of running this script the user will
# be asked to add changes to commit.
# Script return values:
#   0 - default, nothing was changed
#   1 - reuse lint complains, but files haven't been modified
#   2 - files have been modified by the script and have to be staged for commit
#   3 - both 1 and 2
